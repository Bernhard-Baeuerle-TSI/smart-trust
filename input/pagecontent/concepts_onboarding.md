The following describes the onboarding processes for the GDHCN.

Starting in September of 2023, partipcation will be opened to other eligible participants following the Full Onboarding Process (FOP).

Starting in June of 2023 and running throough December 2023, participation in the GDHNC will be open to current participants of the European Union (EU) Digital Covid Certifcate (DCC) network following an Interim Onboarding Process (IOP).  The IOP is an abbreviated verison of the FOP leveraging the notion of transitive trust.

Please review the:
* [Concepts](concepts.html) underpinning the description of these onboarding processes including the general description of the Terms of Participation; and
* [Certificate Governance](concepts_certificate_governance.html) describing the governance of public key certificiates.


### Interim Onboarding Process

This section describes the steps for the Interim Onboarding Process (FOP) to the GDHCH.

As the launch of the WHO Digital Health Trust Network, is expected to be 1 June 2023, only the Trusted Services related to issuance and verification of COVID-19 Certificates will be supported.   WHO will not have access to any of the data contained within a Verifiable Digital Health Certificate that is issued by a Trust Network Participant underone of these Trusted Services.

#### Period of Applicability
The IOP will be in effect at the launch date of the GDHCN on 1 June 2023 and be in effect through December 31, 2023.

##### Eligibility
At launch of IOP , eligibiltiy to join the GDHNC is limited to WHO Member States which are participants in the EU DCC.


#### Transitive Trust
The principle of Transitive Trust leverages the trusted relationship that the EC has already established among its participants within the EU DCC network and uses that as a basis to allow for EU DCC participants to participate in the GDHCN without any overly burdensome onboarding process. This will be referred to as the WHO-EC transitive trust relationship. The IOP outlined in this document is intended to serve as a quick and structured mechanism to onboard those eligible Trust Network Participants.

#### Interim Terms of Participation
The requirements in this document will subsume those outlined in the EC DCC Equivalence Decision Annex II Technical procedure to onboard third countries.  The following abbreviated Terms of Participation will apply during the IOP:
* ***TOP0***  Will leverage current EC processes and share NB<sub>TLS</sub> keys with WHO.  These NB<sub>TLS</sub> keys will be signed by WHO.
* ***TOP1***  Will be considered fulfilled 
* ***TOP2***  Will be considered fulfilled
* ***TOP3***  WHO will ask for an assertion/pledge by eligible Trust Network participants to adhere to the applicable policies but will not be responsible for assessing or enforcing compliance the policies or regulatory on which trusted services which are operated by paricipants of the trust network.


#### Organizational Identify
The organizational identity will be considered established and verified under a WHO-EC Transitive Trust relationship.   The EC will provide to WHO necessary contact information for operators, owners or focal points of EC DCC Trust Network participants to facilitate communication.


#### Onboarding Steps

As permissible, configuration information related to connections of EU DCC participant backend systems will be provided by the EC to the WHO in order to facilitate establishing connections between EU DCC Trust Network Participants and the WHO Digital Health Trust Network infrastructure.  Otherwise, such configuration information will be shared directly by the eligible Trust Network Participant to the WHO


* An eligible Trust Network Participant should submit its Letter of Intent Form (TO BE DEFINED) to tng-secretariat@who.int.
* Once eligibility is verified the eligible Trust Network Participant will be invited to submit a signed Trust Network Application Form (TO BE DEFINED) tng-secretariat@who.int with:
    * the necessary information to connect to the production environment
    * attestation to comply with the Trust Network Terms of Participation.
* After positively assessing the application form,  WHO will:
    * provide the necessary technical specifications and configuration information to connect to their backend systems to the WHO TNG
    * invite the country to register their production certificates and promote them to the production environment.
